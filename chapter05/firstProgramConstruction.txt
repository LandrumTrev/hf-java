HOW TO WRITE A PROGRAM (a game)


How to write a program

-----------------------

Summary:
Create a command-line interface game in the style of Battleship, where the player attempts to guess the location and sink three hidden 3-space DotComs randomly arranged on a 7 by 7 grid, with individual cells indicated by a letter-number code (A-G vertical, 0-6 horizontal). Game's responses to player guesses are "miss", "hit", and "kill" (all three cells of a DotCom are hit for a kill).

-----------------------

Game Flow:
1. User starts a new game
  a. Game creates three DotComs
  b. Game places the DotComs randomly on a virtual grid

2. Game play begins, repeat until no more DotCom cells are left:
  a. Prompt user for a guess (A1, C5, etc)
  b. Check user guess against populated grid for miss (empty cell), hit (cells remaining for that DotCom), kill (no cells remaining for that DotCom)
  c. Check for any remaining DotComs (yes? continue, no? game over)

3. Game finishes
  a. Give user a score/rating based on number of guesses needed to sink all DotComs

-----------------------

Create Flow Chart of game flow process:
  start, actions and conditional decisions, end
  (see GoogleDocs screen shot of flow chart)

-----------------------

Start pseudo-coding by determining all the Objects needed (NOT the Procedures)
